# Codex FileHog

A Rust-based file monitoring tool that watches target directories for changes and stores files or entire folders of data on the Codex storage network. FileHog automatically detects new and modified files, validates them, and uploads data to Codex with configurable monitoring intervals and storage options.

Based on the specifications from [benbierens/codex-filehog](https://github.com/benbierens/codex-filehog).
